    "In this problem, you're going to write a function that will parse (a simplified version of) XML files into a Python object. Although it's not recommended that you use the parser you construct for anything serious (many excellent Python libraries already exist for parsing XML, such as the lxml library), XML files represent a fairly complex file format, that necessitates using regular expressions and recursion (or a stack) to parse these in a reasonably efficient manner.  So while it's not likely that you will need to write you own XML parser, chances are if/when you _do_ need to write a parser for some format for which there exists no good Python library, the techniques you use here will be useful for writing this parser as well."

    "## XML\n",

    "XML stands for the eXtensible Markup Language.  It appeared as a successor to SGML (standard generalized markup language) and HTML (hypertext markup language, the standard for displaying web pages), but with some additional structure that makes the documents more well-defined; for instance, in HTML it's common for open tags to appear without a corresponding close tag, which is not allowed in pure XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may already be familiar with XML, but if not the official resource for learning about the format is here https://www.w3.org/XML/ and a good resource with some concrete examples is here http://www.w3schools.com/xml/.  We'll assume here that you're broadly familiar with the basic ideas behind XML, and just describe what you need to know to complete the parser for this assignment.\n",

    "    \n",
    "There are a few elements here of importance.\n",
    "1. Tags are denoted `<tag_name>content</tag_name>` where `<tag_name>` is the opening tag and `</tag_name>` is the closing tag.  All text (including whitespace) between these tags is the content.\n",
    "2. Attributes follow a tag, and are written as a list of `attr_name=\"attribute_value\"` pairs, where we can use either double quotes or single quotes around the attribute value.  If you use double quotes then a single quote can appear in the text and vice versa.  There can be whitespace around the equals sign or not.\n",
    "3. If a tag has no content `<tag_name attr_name=\"attribute_value\"></tag_name>` can be abbreviated as the open/close tag `<tag_name attr_name=\"attribute_value\"/>`. In some cases, such as in HTML5, you might come across tags that have no content but aren't closed, such as `<meta ...>` and `<link ...>` tags. **However, as we are dealing with XML (a stricter context), tags are required to be closed.** If you're interested, [this document](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_xhtml.asp) on XHTML vs HTML touches upon this idea.\n",
    "4. A XML prologue is written as `<?tag_name attr_name=\"attribute_value\"?>`.  It has no close tag.  We'll also consider documents that allow for an HTML declaration, such as `<!DOCTYPE html>` (this will let us parse some HTML documents that are well-formed enough to also parse as valid XML).\n",
    "5. Comments are denoted by `<!-- comment_text -->`  and the comment text can span multiple lines."

    "## Q1: Regular expression for identifying tags\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll use regular expressions to identify tags and other elements of XML files.  Specifically, you'll need to create 6 regular expressions that locate open tags, close tags, open/close tags, comments, xml_prolog, and html declarations.  For the open, close and open/close tags, make sure that your regular expression also matches and returns 1) the tag name, and 2) all the attributes.  Note that in our implementation, we actually have the open tag _also_ match open/close tags, but you are free to do this either way (they can match or not).  Comments may be split across multiple lines, but you can assume that all other tags must occur on a single line (without newlines within the tag itself)."

First, there will be biweekly homes that work through the  material presented in class, and require students to implement or evaluate relevant algorithms.  These workbooks will be distributed as Jupyter notebooks, and will be submitted for the course via Autolab.  In addition to these assignments, students will themselves develop a new tutorial workbook to teach an advanced topic, and will also work through the content developed by at least two other students.  Finally, students will complete a final class project (in groups), which will be a chance to apply these data science techniques to a problem of the group's choosing.\n",

      "                    A: The demand for this course has been very right: as of the start of classes there are more than 250 people registered or on the waitlist for the course.  We're thrilled about the level of interest, but unfortunately the only available classroom during this time fits at most 136 students. <br/>\n",
      "                    To accomodate as many as people as possible, we created a section DNM (Does Not Meet) section of the 600 level course, which is the B section of the 15-688 course.  This version is identical to the A section, except that <emph>students are expected to watch the lectures online</emph> (all lectures will be available online within a few hours after the end of class).  We expect that attendance will shake out significantly during the first few weeks of the course, and our strong suspicious is that after the first month, there will be space in the lecture hall for anyone (from any section), to attend lectures, but we ask that until we make this clear, students in the B section not regularly attend lecture.\n",

      "                    See above.  We want to accomodate absolutely as many people as possible, but are ultimately limited by the classroom size (and following university policy, the undergraduate lectures have priority for in-class attendence).  However, we really want to emphasize that the courses are <emph>exactly</emph> the same except for the in-class lecture and DNM section (same credit, same homeworks, same office hours, same access to TAs/professor, same tutorial and final project assigments, etc), and there is a good chance that Section B students will end up even being able to attend lectures by the middle of the semester.

There will be plenty of focus on applying algorithms (often best used through existing libraries) to practical problems, but these libraries can be used more effectively when you understand the underlying algorithms well enough to implement them yourself.  So, at least for the more straightforward algorithms that we cover, you will be implementing these yourselves.  The 688 level course assignment will do a bit more of this underlying implementation than the 388 level course. \n",

It is a burgeoning field, currently attracting substantial demand from both academia and industry.</p>\\n                    <p class=\"large text-muted\">This course provides a practical introduction to the \"full stack\" of data science analysis, including data collection and processing, data visualization and presentation, statistical model building using machine learning, and big data techniques for scaling these methods.  Topics covered include: collecting and processing data using relational methods, time series approaches, graph and network models, free text analysis, and spatial geographic methods; analyzing the data using a variety of statistical and machine learning methods include linear and non-linear regression and classification, unsupervised learning and anomaly detection, plus advanced machine learning methods like kernel approaches, boosting, or deep learning; visualizing and presenting data, particularly focusing the case of high-dimensional data; and applying these methods to big data settings, where multiple machines and distributed computation are needed to fully leverage the data.</p>\\n                    <p class=\"large text-muted\"> As the course name suggests, this course will focus on the <em>practical</em> aspects of data science, with a focus on implementing and making use of the above techniques.  Students will complete weekly programming homework that emphasize practical understanding of the methods described in the course.  In addition, students will develop a tutorial on an advanced topic, and will complete a group project that applies these data science techniques to a practical application chosen by the team; these two longer assignments will be done in lieu of a midterm or final.</p>\\n\\n                </div>\\n            </div>\\n\\n\\n            <div class=\"row text-center\">\\n                <div class=\"col-md-4\">\\n                    <span class=\"fa-stack fa-5x\">\\n                        <i class=\"fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x text-primary\"></i>\\n                        <i class=\"fa fa-database fa-stack-1x fa-inverse\"></i>\\n                    </span>\\n                    <h4 class=\"service-heading\">Data collection and processing</h4>\\n                    <p class=\"text-muted large\">Ingest data from unstructured and structured sources, and use relational models, time series algorithms, graph and network processing, natural language processing, geographic information system processes to store and manage the data.</p>\\n                </div>\\n                <div class=\"col-md-4\">\\n                    <span class=\"fa-stack fa-5x\">\\n                        <i class=\"fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x text-primary\"></i>\\n                        <i class=\"fa fa-bar-chart fa-stack-1x fa-inverse\"></i>\\n                    </span>\\n                    <h4 class=\"service-heading\">Statistical modeling</h4>\\n                    <p class=\"text-muted large\">Apply basic statistical techniques and analyses to understand properties of the data and to design experimental setups for testing hypotheses or collecting new data. </p>\\n                </div>\\n                <div class=\"col-md-4\">\\n                    <span class=\"fa-stack fa-5x\">\\n                        <i class=\"fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x text-primary\"></i>\\n                        <i class=\"fa fa-gears fa-stack-1x fa-inverse\"></i>\\n                    </span>\\n                    <h4 class=\"service-heading\">Advanced ML techniques</h4>\\n                    <p class=\"text-muted large\">Apply advanced machine learning algorithms such as kernel methods, boosting, deep learning, anomaly detection, factorization models, and probabilistic modeling to analyze and extract insights from data. </p>\\n                </div>\\n            </div>\\n            <div class=\"row text-center\">\\n                <div class=\"col-md-4 col-md-offset-2\">\\n                    <span class=\"fa-stack fa-5x\">\\n                        <i class=\"fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x text-primary\"></i>\\n                        <i class=\"fa fa-eye fa-stack-1x fa-inverse\"></i>\\n                    </span>\\n                    <h4 class=\"service-heading\">Data visualization</h4>\\n                    <p class=\"text-muted large\">Visualize the data and results from analysis, particularly focusing on visualizing and understanding high-dimensional structured data and the results of statistical and machine learning analysis.</p>\\n                </div>\\n                <div class=\"col-md-4\">\\n                    <span class=\"fa-stack fa-5x\">\\n                        <i class=\"fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x text-primary\"></i>\\n                        <i class=\"fa fa-cloud fa-stack-1x fa-inverse\"></i>\\n                    </span>\\n                    <h4 class=\"service-heading\">Big data</h4>\\n                    <p class=\"text-muted large\">Scale the methods to big data regimes, where distributed storage and computation are needed to fully realize capabilities of data analysis techniques.</p>\\n                </div>\\n            </div>\\n\\n            <div class=\"col-lg-12\" style=\"height:50px;\"></div>\\n            <div class=\"row\">\\n                <div class=\"col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1 well\">\\n                    <h3 class=\"service-heading\">Key information</h3>\\n\\n                    <p class=\"large\">\\n                    <strong>Course number:</strong> 15-388 (undergraduate) / 15-688 (masters) <br/> \\n                    Both courses will have the same lectures, but on each assignment there will be additional advanced problems for the 600 level course.\\n                    </p>\\n\\n                    <p class=\"large\">\\n                    <strong>Course location and time:</strong> Doherty Hall A302, MW 12:00-1:20</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    <p class=\"large\">\\n                    <strong>Units:</strong> 9 (15-388), 12 (15-688)<br/>\\n                    </p>\\n\\n                    <p class=\"large\">\\n                    <strong>Prequisites:</strong> Programming experience is necessary for the course (assignments are in Python).  For CS undergraduates, either 15-112 or 15-122 is required; undergraduates from other departments who have programming background but have not taken the course require instructor approval to enroll.  Experience with linear algebra, probability, and statistic is recommended, but not strictly required (courses like 21-240/241/242 for linear algebra or 36-201 for probability/statistics are more than sufficient).  Students concerned about whether they have a proper background should contact the course instructors to discuss.</p>\\n\\n                    <p class=\"large\">\\n                    <strong>Grading:</strong> 55% homeworks, 15% tutorial, 25% final project, 5% class participation.</p>\\n\\n\\n                </div>\\n            </div>\\n        </div>\\n    </section>\\n\\n    <!-- Schedule Section -->\\n    <section id=\"schedule\">\\n        <div class=\"container\">\\n            <div class=\"row\">\\n                <div class=\"col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1\">\\n                    <h2 class=\"section-heading text-center\">Schedule</h2>\\n                    <p class=\"large text-muted\">This schedule is tentative and subject to change, and precise dates will be added closer to the course start date.

First, there will be biweekly homes that work through the  material presented in class, and require students to implement or evaluate relevant algorithms.  These workbooks will be distributed as Jupyter notebooks, and will be submitted for the course via Autolab.  In addition to these assignments, students will themselves develop a new tutorial workbook to teach an advanced topic, and will also work through the content developed by at least two other students.  Finally, students will complete a final class project (in groups), which will be a chance to apply these data science techniques to a problem of the group\\'s choosing.\\n                    </p>\\n\\n                    <p class=\"large text-muted\"> There is no midterm or final in the course.

We\\'re thrilled about the level of interest, but unfortunately the only available classroom during this time fits at most 136 students. <br/>\\n                    To accomodate as many as people as possible, we created a section DNM (Does Not Meet) section of the 600 level course, which is the B section of the 15-688 course.  This version is identical to the A section, except that <emph>students are expected to watch the lectures online</emph> (all lectures will be available online within a few hours after the end of class).  We expect that attendance will shake out significantly during the first few weeks of the course, and our strong suspicious is that after the first month, there will be space in the lecture hall for anyone (from any section), to attend lectures, but we ask that until we make this clear, students in the B section not regularly attend lecture.\\n                    </p>\\n\\n                    <p class=\"large text-muted\"><b>Q: I really want to take the in-person 15-688 Section A.  Will I be able to get off the waitlist?</b>  <br/>\\n                    See above.  We want to accomodate absolutely as many people as possible, but are ultimately limited by the classroom size (and following university policy, the undergraduate lectures have priority for in-class attendence).  However, we really want to emphasize that the courses are <emph>exactly</emph> the same except for the in-class lecture and DNM section (same credit, same homeworks, same office hours, same access to TAs/professor, same tutorial and final project assigments, etc), and there is a good chance that Section B students will end up even being able to attend lectures by the middle of the semester.  So please consider enrolling in Section B if you are in this position. \\n                    </p>\\n\\n\\n                    <p class=\"large text-muted\"><b>Q: I\\'m on the waitlist for the 15-388 version.  Will I be able to get off the waitlist?</b>  <br/>\\n                    Yes, almost definitely.  There is a relatively small waitlist for the 300 version currently, and we absolutely expect all students who stick around a few weeks to get off the waitlist.\\n                    </p>\\n\\n                    <p class=\"large text-muted\"><b>Q: How does the 5% class participation grade work for students in the DNM section?</b>  <br/>\\n                    Given the size of this course, for all students (including 15-388/15-688A students) the class participation grade will be based upon participating in the course forums on <a href=\"https://piazza.com/class/is8ghyly8um4ew\">Piazza</a>, not upon speaking up in class.\\n                    </p>\\n\\n\\n                    <p class=\"large text-muted\"> \\n                    <b>Q: Is there a pointer to materials from a previous year?</b>\\n                    <br/>\\n                    A: No, Fall 2016 is the first time this course is being offered, so we don\\'t have past materials to look over.  Feel free to contact the instructors if you have questions about the content of the course which aren\\'t answered here.\\n                    </p>\\n\\n                    <p class=\"large text-muted\"> \\n                    <b>Q: Does this course count toward the MSCS AI requirement?</b>\\n                    <br/>\\n                    A: (Corrected version).  We still need to confirm whether this will be the case or not.  We\\'ll update the website and soon as we know, and please email us if this situation affects you.\\n                    </p>\\n                    \\n\\n                    <p class=\"large text-muted\"> \\n                    <b>Q: Will the course be offered during the spring semester?</b>\\n                    <br/>\\n                    A: No, the soonest the course will be offered again is during Fall 2017.\\n                    </p>\\n                    \\n\\n                    <p class=\"large text-muted\"> \\n                    <b>Q: Will this course focus mainly on applying techniques from existing libraries to practical data science problems, or writing the underlying algorithms from scratch?</b>\\n                    <br/>\\n                    A: Both, to a certain extent.  There will be plenty of focus on applying algorithms (often best used through existing libraries) to practical problems, but these libraries can be used more effectively when you understand the underlying algorithms well enough to implement them yourself.  So, at least for the more straightforward algorithms that we cover, you will be implementing these yourselves.  The 688 level course assignment will do a bit more of this underlying implementation than the 388 level course. \\n                    </p>\\n\\n                    <p class=\"large text-muted\"> \\n                    <b>Q: I have a question that wasn\\'t asked here. </b>\\n                    <br/>\\n                    A: Come to office hours, or ask on the course <a href=\"https://piazza.com/class/is8ghyly8um4ew\">Piazza</a>. \\n                    </p>\\n                </div>\\n            </div>\\n        </div>\\n    </section>\\n\\n\\n\\n    <footer class=\"bg-light-gray\">\\n        <div class=\"container\">\\n            <div class=\"row\">\\n                <div class=\"col-lg-12\">\\n                    <span class=\"copyright\">Copyright &copy; Carnegie\\n                        Mellon University 2016</span>\\n                </div>\\n            </div>\\n        </div>\\n    </footer>\\n\\n\\n    <!-- jQuery -->\\n    <script src=\"js/jquery.js\"></script>\\n\\n    <!-- Bootstrap Core JavaScript -->\\n    <script src=\"js/bootstrap.min.js\"></script>\\n\\n    <!-- Plugin JavaScript -->\\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-easing/1.3/jquery.easing.min.js\"></script>\\n    <script src=\"js/classie.js\"></script>\\n    <script src=\"js/cbpAnimatedHeader.js\"></script>\\n\\n    <!-- Contact Form JavaScript -->\\n    <script src=\"js/jqBootstrapValidation.js\"></script>\\n    <script src=\"js/contact_me.js\"></script>\\n\\n    <!-- Custom Theme JavaScript -->\\n    <script src=\"js/agency.js\"></script>\\n\\n</body>\\n\\n</html>\\n'\n",

Note that if you want you could make a full string copy here, but we don't bother.  Now we begin parsing the file, which we do by repeating the following logic until termination:\n",

If it's just an open tag, then recursively create an XMLNode object initializer this tag and attributes, and the content that occurred after the open tag.  If it's an open/close tag, create a XMLNode the same as before but with empty content.\n",
    "4. If it's a close tag, make sure that the close tag matches the tag originally provided to the current XMLNode constructor (otherwise, we have a situation where one tag is closed with a different tag), and raise an Exception if not.  If the tags do match, then truncate the content to contain only the content before the closed tag matched, and return.\n",

If this function returns `None`, then the regular expression did not match.  In the returned `match` object, `match.end()` contains the position where the match ended."
